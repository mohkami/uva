This repository includes codes related to UVA Online Judge (https://uva.onlinejudge.org) problems.


### Notes
 1. Your input comes from `System.in` and output to `System.out`. So you can use `Scanner` to read from input:
    ```java
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int firstLineNumber = = scanner.nextInt();
    ```
 2. Make sure that the name of the class you are submitting is "Main"
 3. Make sure the class is not inside another package that is you should not have something like "package p10300;" in the first line of your code.
