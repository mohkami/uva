### Tips or Tricks:
1. Numbers or anything between letters are considered as space. That is the following string contains 2 words: `asf12312312asfsd`
2. If you are using split (using regex), it counts an empty string before space or anything before a word in the string (at the beginning of the string). That is it counts  this string `23413 safdasfds`
